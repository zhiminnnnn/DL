## Case Study
<div align="justify">

>***"A hotel visitor want to use a building lift to go up from one level to another. The requirements are put in the desired level to go, tag the visitor room card, closed the lift door, and push UP 
button. Then, the lift will goes up by counting up one level to another until its reaches to the desired level. The door will open and at the same time alert will be given to the visitors. 
Similarly, the reverse process happen when the visitor want to go down. The counting sequence will decrease until it reaches to the desired floor"***

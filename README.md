# SECR1013 Digital Logic
```yaml
Section : 03
Lecturer: Ts. Dr. Raja Zahilah Binti Raja Mohd Radzi
```
This course introduces the fundamentals of digital electronics, which form the basis of how computers and digital systems work. Covers core topics such as number systems, logic gates, Boolean algebra, and combinational and sequential circuits. The course also guides students through designing and analyzing circuits like adders, multiplexers, flip-flops, counters, and shift registers. Through labs and a design project using Deeds software and real hardware, students will gain hands-on experience building and testing digital logic circuits. By the end, students will be able to apply digital logic concepts to solve problems and design practical, efficient digital systems.

## Reflection
This lab is really cool because we get to build and test logic circuits using the ETS-5000 Digital Training System. We learn how to make circuits using basic logic gates like AND, OR and NOT on a breadboard. We use switches to set the logic levels. We can see the results through the LEDs. We also use probes to check the connections. 

I learned a lot from this lab about the physical implementation of basic logic gates using ICs like 7408 and 7432 and 7404. I now know how to put together logic gates to make more complex circuits. For example I learned how to make an XOR gate using AND, OR, and NOT gates.

Concerning test and debug skills, I have gained the skill of testing circuits to determine the actual results against theoretical results. Another tool that we make use of is the probe. We use it to test the power as well as the signal at certain points within the circuit to understand what is going wrong. Skills related to test and debug are quite valuable to us because they make us think critically.

I learned a great deal in this lab as far as how what I learned in class relates to the physical components. Hand-in-hand with my increased confidence in working with electronic components, I learned how a small mistake will propagate throughout a circuit, making attention to detail extremely important. This lab provides a great basis for my upcoming lessons on digital logic.

## Reflection
The ETS-5000 Digital Training System was utilized to build and test various logic circuits. Basic logic gates, including AND, OR, and NOT, were constructed on a breadboard. Logic levels were set using switches, while results were observed via LEDs. Circuit connections were verified through the use of probes.
### Technical Implementation
Significant knowledge was gained regarding the physical implementation of logic gates using integrated circuits such as the 7408, 7432, and 7404. The process of combining basic gates to form complex circuits was mastered; for instance, an XOR gate was successfully assembled using a combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates.
### Testing and Debugging
Valuable testing and debugging skills were developed. Circuits were rigorously tested to compare actual results against theoretical expectations. The logic probe was employed to monitor power levels and signal integrity at specific points, allowing for the identification of circuit malfunctions. These skills are considered highly valuable, as critical thinking is required throughout the troubleshooting process.
### Conclusion and Key Takeaways
A clear connection was established between theoretical classroom concepts and physical electronic components. Increased confidence was gained in handling hardware, and the importance of attention to detail was highlighted by observing how minor errors can propagate throughout a circuit. A solid foundation has been provided for upcoming lessons in digital logic.

# Lab 1 - Reflection
Date: 17 Nov 2025

This lab is really cool because we get to build and test logic circuits using the ETS-5000 Digital Training System. We learn how to make circuits using basic logic gates like AND, OR and NOT on a breadboard. We use switches to set the logic levels. We can see the results through the LEDs. We also use probes to check the connections. 

I learned a lot from this lab about the physical implementation of basic logic gates using ICs like 7408 and 7432 and 7404. I now know how to put together logic gates to make more complex circuits. For example I learned how to make an XOR gate using AND, OR, and NOT gates.

When it comes to testing and debugging skills, I learned how to test circuits to see how the actual results match up with theory. We also use a probe to check the power and signal at different points in the circuit. This helps us figure out what is going wrong. Testing and debugging skills are really important. They help us solve problems and think critically.

Overall, this lab helped me connect what I learned in theory to real hardware. I also became more confident in using electronic parts and checking my wiring. Most importantly, I learned that small mistakes can affect the whole circuit, so being careful is very important. This lab gives me a good foundation for future digital logic lessons and projects.
